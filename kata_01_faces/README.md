# Kata 01: Faces

## Product Description

You'll create a program that allows users to render human faces from some
specification.

## The Kata's Purpose

* Learn to create feature branches and merge them back to a development branch
* Learn how to release software to your end users

## The Process

The product is small enough to complete three releases in 6 sprints of 10
minutes each.

Refer to the [main README](../README.md#how-does-it-work) for how to work with
the backlog.

## Roles

* Product Owner: You will be asked about what to create.  You will have to
  accept (or reject) the sprint's output.
* Developer: You'll have to understand the defined user stories.
* Release Manager: You'll have to guide the release process: define the version
  number/name, create a release note for the end users.
* End User: When the new version arrives, you'll wonder what is in it, and create
  a face with it.

## Preparation

1. Read through the product backlog.  It's prioritized, so you can take up the
   first user stories in a first sprint.
2. Create a (shared) empty code repository to work with.  Every one on the team
   should pull that repository.
3. Decide what programming language you'll use; every one on the team should
   have the proper tools installed.

## Go

For each sprint, choose who takes up the role of the End User. This user should
leave the process room until the next version is released.

Now plan the sprint. Divide the work: create a feature branch for each story,
start implementing and merge to development branch when ready.

After the second sprint, create a release branch, add a release note document
and a changelog document. Then tag the release. Now after the sprint review,
call in the End User and hand them the tagged software.

As an End User, pretend you know the previous version only. From the release
notes, you should be able to find out what's in this release for you.

## Retrospective

After the Kata, take a moment to decide

* Individually:
  * what skills did you learn this time?
  * what insights did you get this time?
  * is there anything you want to exercise more?
* As a team:
  * what can you apply to your daily work?
  * what collaboration skills did you achieve?
