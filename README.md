# Backlog To Version Control Kata (BaVCo)

Team exercises for converting a product backlog to a version controlled piece
of software.

## Version Control meets App Lifecycle Management

Many starting teams struggle when combining a (scrum) backlog, parallel
collaboration, branching and maintaining a clean version history. It's not that
hard, really, but practice makes perfect. This practice, traditionally
postponed to when it's needed, is really needed to avoid future discussion,
roadblocks, hard-to-correct version history mistakes.

Things you don't do very often (a quarterly release train, fire drills) are
hard to get right.

## What's in here?

Since there's plenty of explanation on the web already, we'll keep this brief
and mostly reference to others. The focus is on defining Kata that you can do
with a team to practice the model.

The Kata should not take longer than an hour to complete (given the right tools
are installed).

Like all Kata, you can (and should) redo them to keep your skills alive.

## What if I don't do Gitlab Flow?

Doesn't matter much right now; the idea is that you have

* a product backlog
* features you work on in parallel
* a release every now and then

The Kata should allow you to recognise your model.

## How does it Work? <a name="how-does-it-work"></a>

Each `kata_NN_...` directory describes a kata with a `README.md` and a
`backlog.md` file.

The `backlog.md` file contains the backlog as a simple bullet list of user
stories labeled 'TODO'.

Before starting a kata, make a new, team-shared fork of this repository.  While
resolving items on the backlog, gradually replace the 'TODO' tags with 'DONE'.

## Reading Material

Plenty has been written out there already.
