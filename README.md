# Backlog To Version Control Kata (BaVCo)

Team exercises for converting a product backlog to a version controlled piece of software.

## Version Control meets App Lifecycle Management

Many starting teams struggle when combining a (scrum) backlog, parallel collaboration, branching and maintaining a clean version history.  It's not that hard, really, but practice makes perfect.  This practice, traditionally postponed to when it's needed, is really needed to avoid future discussion, roadblocks, hard-to-correct version history mistakes.

Things you don't do very often (a quarterly release train, fire drills) are hard to get right.

## What's in here?

Since there's plenty of explanation on the web already, we'll keep this brief and mostly reference to others.  The focus is on defining Kata that you can do with a team to practice the model.

The Kata should not take longer than an hour to complete (given the right tools are installed).

Like all Kata, you can (and should) redo them to keep your skills alive.


## What if I don't do Gitlab Flow?

Doesn't matter much right now; the idea is that you have

* a product backlog
* features you work on in parallel
* a release every now and then

The Kata should allow you to recognise your model.
