# Kata 01: Faces

## Product Description

You'll create a program that allows users to render human faces from some specification.

## The Kata's Purpose

* Learn to create feature branches and merge them back to a development branch
* Learn how to release software to your end users

## The Process

The product is small enough to complete three releases in 6 sprints of 10 minutes each.

## Roles

* Product Owner: You will be asked about what to create.  You will have to accept (or reject) the sprint's output.
* Developer: You'll have to understand the defined user stories.
* Release Manager: You'll have to guide the release process: define the version number/name, create a release note for the end users.
* End User: When the new version arrives, you'll wonder what is in it, and create a face with it.

## Preparation

1. Read through the product backlog.  It's prioritized, so you can take up the first user stories in a first sprint.
2. Create a (shared) empty code repository to work with.  Every one on the team should pull that repository.
3. Decide what programming language you'll use; every one on the team should have the proper tools installed.

## Retrospective

Take a moment to decide

* Individually:
  * what skills did you learn this time?
  * what insights did you get this time?
  * is there anything you want to exercise more?
* As a team:
  * what can you apply to your daily work?
  * what collaboration skills did you achieve?
